To install certtools:

Required tools:
GNU bash, Make and perl

basic POSIX tools, including:
      tar, install

Strongly recommended:
gpg

You do NOT need to clone the repository unless you want to submit patches.

Obtain a release tarball from https://github.com/tlhackque/certtools
 - Look for the "Releases" note on the right side of the page, and click "Latest"
 - Under "Assets", click a versioned tarball and corresponding signature link
   (Or download using a command line tool such as wget or curl)

e.g. if the latest release is V2.1.2, you could obtain it with:
  wget htps://github.com/tlhackque/certtools/releases/download/V2.1.2/certtools-2.1.2.tar.xz
  wget htps://github.com/tlhackque/certtools/releases/download/V2.1.2/certtools-2.1.2.tar.xz.sig

Verify and unpack the tarball, e.g.
gpg --verify certtools-2.1.2.tar.xz.sig && tar -xf certtools-2.1.2.tar.xz && cd certtools-2.1.2

To install in the default locations (/usr/local/sbin and /usr/local/share/man/man1):

make install

The installer will check for Perl modules that are required by the Perl-based tools.  If any
are missing or too old, it wil provide instructions for obtaining them.

To install in an alternate root, e.g. /opt:

make prefix=/opt install

To stage when incorporating in a larger system kit:

DESTDIR=/opt/stage make
DESTDIR=/opt/stage prefix=/usr

For more complex requirements, see the Makefile.

You can delete the directory into which you unpacked the release.

Note that the release tarball does not include the .md version of the documentation;
these are provided for easy browsing on GitHub.  The contents are the same as the man
pages and the --man (or -h) output from the tools.  --man (for the Perl tools) and -h
(for the bash tools) are preferred, since they can't be separated from their tool.

Building release kits requires additional tools:

If the necessary tools can't be found on PATH, make variables can be
set for each one in the make invocation - though if necessary for more
than one or two, it's better to set an appropriate PATH.
