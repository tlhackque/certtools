.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
All options can be specified on the command line and in initialization files.
.PP
Indirect command files (\fR\f(CI@file\fR\fI\fR) support a subset of the options that affect how \fIssl_status\fR
connects to systems and what certificates are requested. Thes options are marked \fI\fR\f(CI@file\fR\fI\fR below.
When used in an indrect command file, they affect only systems mentioned on the same (possibly
continued) line on which they occur.  When used on the command line or initialization file,
they affect systems listed there, and also serve as defaults for systems lised in indirect command
files.
.IP "\fB\-\-brief\fR \fB\-\-no\-brief\fR" 8
.IX Item "--brief --no-brief"
Abbreviate report contents for easier reading (default).  Use \fB\-\-no\-brief\fR if output will be parsed by a script.
.Sp
Currently, \fB\-\-brief\fR avoids repeating the hostname in adjacent rows, but this may be changed.
Note that if a host's certificates expire on different dates, data from other hosts may prevent
abbreviation.
.IP "\fB\-\-CAfile\fR=\fIfile\fR \fB\-\-no\-CAfile\fR" 8
.IX Item "--CAfile=file --no-CAfile"
Specify a file containing one or more trusted CA certificates to verify the host's certificate chain.
.Sp
If not specified, the environment variables SSL_CERT_FILE and CURL_CA_BUNDLE will be tried, and if neither of them is set, OpenSSL's default will be used.
.Sp
If \fB\-\-no\-CAfile\fR is specified, the environment variables are ignored and the system default is used.
.ie n .IP "\fB\-\-CApath\fR=\fIdir\fR \fB\-\-CAdir\fR=\fIdir\fR \fB\-\-no\-CApath\fR \fB\-\-no\-CAdir\fR \fR\fI@file\fR\fI\fR" 8

.IX Item "--CApath=dir --CAdir=dir --no-CApath --no-CAdir @file"
Specify a directory containing hashed links to one or more trusted CA certificates to verify the host's certificate chain.
.Sp
If not specified, the environment variable SSL_CERT_DIR will be tried.  If it is not set, OpenSSL's default will be used.
.Sp
If \fB\-\-no\-CApath\fR or \fB\-\-no\-CAdir\fR is specified, the environment variables are ignored and the system default is used.
.IP "\fB\-\-email\-to\fR=\fIlist\fR \fB\-\-no\-email\fR" 8
.IX Item "--email-to=list --no-email"
When generating e\-mails, send to this (comma separated) list.  May be specified more than once.
.IP "\fB\-\-email\-from\fR=\fIaddress\fR \fB\-\-no\-email\-from\fR" 8
.IX Item "--email-from=address --no-email-from"
When generating e\-mails, use this address as the sender.  This is a privileged operation that may not be supported
in some environments.
.Sp
If not specified, the mailer will generate a default sender address, usually based on the user under which it is running.
.IP \fB\-\-format\fR=\fItype\fR 8
.IX Item "--format=type"
Generate a report in the specified format: \fItext\fR, \fIMIME\fR,  or \fIHTML\fR.
.Sp
\&\fIMIME\fR includes both text and HTML in MIME format, and is implied by \fI\-\-email\-to\fR.
.Sp
The default is \fItext\fR.
.IP \fB\-\-initialization\-file\fR=\fIFILE\fR 8
.IX Item "--initialization-file=FILE"
Read \fIFILE\fR instead of the default initialization file.  \fIFILE\fR must exist.
.IP \fB\-\-no\-init\fR 8
.IX Item "--no-init"
Inhibits reading the initialization file, which (when present) supplies command arguments that are processed before
what is typed on the command line.
.IP "\fB\-\-logo\fR=\fIFILE\fR \fB\-\-logo\fR=\fIURL\fR" 8
.IX Item "--logo=FILE --logo=URL"
By default, HTML output includes a logo and heading.  You can replace the built-in logo by specifying a \fIpng\fR, \fIjpg\fR, or \fIsvg\fR file.
.Sp
If you don't want the logo and heading, use \fB\-\-no\-logo\fR.
.IP \fB\-\-pretend\-its\fR=\fIdays\fR 8
.IX Item "--pretend-its=days"
Adjust the current time by \fIdays\fR (use + to advance, \- to go back).
.Sp
Advancing makes future certificate expirations closer (and overdue times longer), while
going back can make expired certificates seem unexpired (or less overdue).
.Sp
Used for testing expiration warnings/actions.
.ie n .IP "\fB\-\-renewbefore\fR=\fIdays\fR \fR\fI@file\fR\fI\fR" 8

.IP \fB\-\-smtp\-server\fR=\fI=host\fR 8
.IX Item "--smtp-server==host"
Specify host/host:port for SMTP server for sending e\-mail.
.Sp
For unprotected SMTP or STARTTLS, the port is usually 587 or 25.  For direct SSL, 465.
.Sp
The port will default to 25 or 465 depending on \fI\-\-smtp\-ssl\-mode\fR.
.Sp
If specified more than once, or a comma-separated list is specified, the first available server will be used.
.IP \fB\-\-smtp\-username\fR=\fIuser\fR 8

.IP \fB\-\-smtp\-ssl_mode\fR=\fIkey\fR 8
.IX Item "--smtp-ssl_mode=key"
Specify whether SSL/TLS is used for SMTP server connection.
.Sp
\&\fIkey\fR is \fBno\fR for unprotected SMTP (port 25), \fByes\fR for direct SSL (port 465), or \fBstarttls\fR (port 25) for
upgrading an unprotected SMTP connection to TLS with the \fIstarttls\fR command.
.Sp
If an explict port (e.g. 587) is specified, it will be used.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBssl_status\fR will connect to each host specified and obtain its certificate and any intermediate certificate chain.
.PP
Port can be numeric, or a service name (e.g. from /etc/services).
.PP
If a port is not specified: if \-\-starttls is specified, the default port for the STARTTLS protocol is used, otherwise 443 (https) is assumed.
.PP
If the port is specified as \fIFILE\fR, \fBssl_status\fR will open the specified file and process it as if the certificates were received from a server.
The certificate chain must be in PEM format.  If a filename begins with '.', '/', or '~', or if it contains a '/', the \fI:FILE\fR is inferred, since
no DNS hostname or IP address can have those forms.
.PP
If an argument is of the form \fR\f(CI@file\fR\fI\fR, the file is processed as a list of commands, one per line, in any of the forms described previously.
A line can contain one or more hosts as well as options that apply only to the hosts on that line.
.PP
The host-specific options that can be specified in an \fR\f(CI@file\fR\fI\fR are: \fI\-\-CAfile\fR, \fI\-\-CApath\fR, \fI\-\-renewefore\fR, \fI\-\-starttls\fR, \fI\-\-timout\fR, \fI\-\-tlsversion\fR, and \fI\-\-type\fR.
If these are specified on the command line (or equivalently, in an initialization file), they will be used as defaults for
\&\fI\fR\f(CI@file\fR\fI\fR hosts.  Options can be negated \- e.g. if most hosts are dual-certificate, you might use \fI\-\-type=ec,rsa\fR on the command line, and
exclude a single host in an \fI\fR\f(CI@file\fR\fI\fR with \fI\-\-type=rsa\fR or \fI\-\-no\-type\fR.  Options specified in an \fI\fR\f(CI@file\fR\fI\fR only apply to the
line on which the occur.  However, lines can be continued using a \e (backslash) as the last character of a line.
.PP
\&\fR\f(CI@file\fR\fI\fRs can be nested, but attempting to process the same file more than once is an error.  In an \fI\fR\f(CI@file\fR\fI\fR, blank lines and lines beginning with \fI#\fR are ignored.
.PP
\&\fIFILE\fR and \fR\f(CI@file\fR\fI\fR names support tilde expansion, but not wildcards.
.PP
The validity dates of each certificate returned will be verified, as will its chain.
.PP
To request the desired certificate from  dual-certificate servers, you can specify \fB\-\-type\fR=\fIec\fR or \fB\-\-type\fR=\fIrsa\fR.
This is done by providing a list of acceptable signature algorithms; the connecion will fail if the server doesn't have a matching certificate.
.PP
You can also specify \fB\-\-tlsversion\fR=\fI1.1\fR, \fB\-\-tlsversion\fR=\fI1.2\fR, or \fB\-\-tlsversion\fR=\fI1.3\fR to select the protocol version.
.PP
Each certificate is analyzed in the order received from the server or contained in the file, which should be from leaf (the server) toward the root (trusted CA).
The trust root is not sent by the server, but is located by OpenSSL via \-CAfile or \-CApath.
.PP
Any date or verification errors will be reported.
.PP
Note that if a trusted (root) certificate has expired, only the root name is available.
.PP
The default output is a table, ordered by days until expiration, summarizing the status of each
host/file's certificate.  Typically, one would run this weekly in order to make sure
that certificates are being renewed.  The analysis is similar to \fBssl_check_chain\fR,
but the result is condensed to one (or with long filenames, two) lines per host.
.PP
The \fB\-\-select\fR option allows you to select other output.
.PP
The default output format is plain text.  HTML can be selected \- for example, if you wish to provide the output as a web page.  MIME is used when the output is e\-mailed.
.PP
You can specify common options in an initialization file, which is processed before the command line.
.PP
The initialization file for Unix systems is the first of \fI./.ssl_status\fR, \fR\f(CI$HOME\fR\fI/.ssl_status\fR, \fI/etc/sysconfig/ssl_status\fR, and \fI/etc/default/ssl_status\fR.
.PP
For Windows systems: \fI.\e.ssl_status.ini\fR, \fR\f(CI%HOMEDRIVE\fR\fI%%HOMEPATH%\e.ssl_status.ini\fR, \fI\fR\f(CI%SSLSTATUS\fR\fI%\essl_status.ini\fR.
.PP
For VMS systems: \fISYS$DISK:[]ssl_status.ini\fR, \fISYS$LOGIN:ssl_status.ini\fR, \fISYS$SYSTEM:ssl_status.ini\fR.
.PP
For any other system: \fI./.ssl_status\fR
.PP
Comments (beginning with \fI#\fR) are ignored, and the contents  are treated as though they were typed on the
command line \- with the same quoting rules.
.PP
Should you wish to override the options in the initialization file, you can specify the
\&\fB\-\-no\-init\fR option on the command line.  \fB\-\-initialization\-file\fR specifies an alternative file.
